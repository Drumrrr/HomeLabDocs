# Equipment Overview
    Here is an overview of the hardware that makes up my home lab. Right now, It is on the smaller side, but it will grow as time goes on.

# The-Shire
    The shire is currently the primary server of my network. It's an intel Nuc with a core i3-4010u, 4gb of ram, running Ubuntu server 24.04.
# Argonath
    The argonath is my tp-link 5 port network switch. Simply its means to connect The-Shire to Badadur with extra ports open for expansion in the future.

# Nazgul
    Nazgul is my 2013 11" macbook air. This tiny beast has 4 gigs of ram, a core i5-2467M, a busted battery, and a lightweight linux distro to make the most of it all. Currently it's used as my linux learning enviroment and pentesting swissarmy knife. 
# Ba-Dadur
