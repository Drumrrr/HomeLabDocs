## About me and this project
Howdy! My name is Kyle Matthews, I'm a software engineering student studying at Clarkson University. This is the documentation for my Home Server. Right now there isnt anything too impressive going on with my hardware, but I'm building my way up to having something impressive. I hope you stick with me on this journey!
